# demand_forecasting

This is my personal project about demand forecasting. The objective is to predict item sales at different store locations.

There are about 800.000 rows of data.

Data Fields:
1. date: date of sales data
2. store: store id
3. item: item id
4. sales: number of items sold at particular store

Note: Please reload the Jupyter Notebook file (.ipnyb) if the page doesn't load. Sometimes, it takes two to four times of reload until the pages shows up.
